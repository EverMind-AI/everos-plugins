# everos-tools

Official EverOS developer tools for AI coding assistants.

## Available Plugins

### everos-sdk-upgrade

Migrate an EverOS Cloud integration between API/SDK versions.

- **Python SDK** (`everos-cloud` / `evermemos`) — full rule coverage
- **Raw HTTP callers in any language** — endpoint, payload and response rules
- Detects the current version and chains rules to the target
- **Flags capabilities that have no equivalent in the target version** instead of
  silently dropping or approximating them
- `--scan` mode produces an impact report without editing anything

## Installation (Claude Code)

```bash
# 1. Add marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add EverMind-AI/everos-tools

# 2. Install the plugin
/plugin install everos-sdk-upgrade@everos-tools

# 3. See what a migration would involve, without changing anything
/everos-sdk-upgrade --scan

# 4. Run it
/everos-sdk-upgrade

# 5. Update to the latest rules
/plugin marketplace update
```

## Other AI Tools (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cline, Amp, Warp, Goose, Junie, and 45+ supported)

This skill follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Install with one command:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/EverMind-AI/everos-tools
```

The CLI auto-detects your installed tools and copies the skill to the correct directories.

## Supported migrations

| Hop | Caller | Rule file |
|---|---|---|
| v0 -> v1 (`evermemos` -> `everos-cloud` 0.x) | Python SDK | `migration/python/v0-to-v1.md` |
| v1 -> v2 (API v1 -> v2) | Any HTTP caller | `migration/http/v1-to-v2.md` |
| v1 -> v2 (`everos-cloud` 0.4.x -> 1.x) | Python SDK | `migration/python/v1-to-v2.md` |

### A note on version names

Three version numbers move independently, which is a common source of confusion:

| | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| pip package | `everos-cloud` 0.4.x | `everos-cloud` 1.x |
| Memory API | v1 (`/api/v1/memories/*`) | v2 (`/api/v2/memory/*`) |
| Rule files here | `v1` | `v2` |

Rule files are named after the **API** version. When describing the upgrade to users,
say **"everos-cloud 1.x (the v2 Memory API)"** rather than a bare "v2".

`SKILL.md`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` are
fixed names required by the Agent Skills standard and the Claude Code plugin spec —
they are not free to rename.

## Adding Migration Rules

When a new API or SDK version ships:

1. Add `skills/everos-sdk-upgrade/migration/http/vN-to-vN+1.md` — the transport-level
   rules. This is the source of truth and covers every caller in every language.
2. Add `skills/everos-sdk-upgrade/migration/{lang}/vN-to-vN+1.md` for each SDK, mapping
   its method signatures onto the transport rules.
3. Add `skills/everos-sdk-upgrade/examples/{lang}/vN+1.{ext}` for major versions.
4. Update the `version` field in `plugin.json`.
5. Update the version-detection table in `SKILL.md` if the new SDK changed how a
   version can be recognised from call sites.
6. Push to this repository.

Users run `/plugin marketplace update` to get the latest rules.

### Rule-writing conventions

- Every rule gets a stable id (`API-0NN` for transport, `SDK-0NN` for Python) so the
  other files and the generated report can cite it.
- Mark each rule's **Change Type**: `BREAKING`, `BEHAVIOURAL`, `NEW`, `OPERATIONAL`
  or `NONE - Informational`.
- Give **Before/After** code, **Search Patterns**, and **Steps**.
- A capability removed with no replacement gets an explicit "FLAG, do not rewrite"
  instruction and suggested comment wording.
- Note where a claim was verified (published wheel, OpenAPI contract, or live API) so
  the next person can re-check it.
