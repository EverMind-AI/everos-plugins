# EverOS Migration

Migrate an EverOS Cloud integration from any version to a target version (default:
latest). Two kinds of caller are supported:

- **Python SDK** (`everos-cloud` / `evermemos`) — full rule coverage
- **Raw HTTP** in any language — endpoint, payload, and response rules; rewrites are
  guided rather than mechanical

Go and TypeScript *SDKs* do not exist yet; code in those languages that calls the API
directly over HTTP **is** covered by the raw-HTTP path.

## Mode: scan vs. migrate

If the user passed `--scan` (or asked for a report / dry run / impact assessment):
run Steps 1–4, then produce the **Impact Report** (see the end of this file) and
**stop without editing any file**.

Otherwise run all steps and edit.

Prefer scan mode when the user is deciding *whether* to migrate rather than doing it.

---

## Step 1: Detect how the code talks to EverOS

Run both detections — a codebase can do both (SDK in one service, raw HTTP in another).

**A. SDK usage:**
```
Grep pattern="evermemos|everos_cloud|everos-cloud" glob="*.{py,toml,txt,cfg,lock}"
```

**B. Raw HTTP usage (any language):**
```
Grep pattern="api\.evermind\.ai|/api/v1/memories|/api/v2/memory|EVEROS_API_KEY|EVER_OS_BASE_URL"
```

Classify:
- **Python SDK**: `evermemos` / `everos_cloud` found in `*.py` or a dependency file
  -> ✓ supported, full rules
- **Raw HTTP**: `/api/v1/` or `api.evermind.ai` found in any source, config, `.http`
  file, Postman collection, or test fixture -> ✓ supported, transport rules
- **Go/TS SDK**: an EverOS *SDK* import in `go.mod` / `package.json` -> ✗ does not exist;
  if you see this, it is almost certainly raw HTTP — treat it as such

If neither is found, tell the user no EverOS usage was detected and stop.

## Step 2: Detect the current version

**Do NOT rely on a `client.vN.` prefix.** That pattern identifies 0.4.x and earlier
only — the 1.x facade removed it entirely (`client.add(...)`, not
`client.v1.memories.add(...)`), so a 1.x codebase has no version marker in its call
sites at all.

Decide in this order, stopping at the first match:

| Evidence | Version |
|---|---|
| `evermemos` package + `client.v0.` | **v0** (SDK 0.x, `evermemos`) |
| `everos-cloud` dependency pinned `<1`, or `>=0.4`, or `client.v1.` call sites | **v1** (SDK 0.4.x) |
| `everos-cloud` dependency `>=1`, or bare facade verbs (`client.add(`, `client.search(`, `client.flush(`) with no `.v1.` anywhere | **v2** (SDK 1.x) — already current |
| Raw HTTP hitting `/api/v1/` | **v1** |
| Raw HTTP hitting `/api/v2/` | **v2** — already current |

If the code is already on the target, say so and stop — do not re-apply rules.
If the evidence is mixed (some `/api/v1/` and some `/api/v2/`), report the split and
migrate only the v1 parts.

## Step 3: Determine the target version

- If the user specified one (`/everos-sdk-upgrade v2`), use it.
- Otherwise use the highest version discoverable from the rule files (Step 4).

Accept `v2`, `1.x`, `1.1.0` and `latest` as names for the same target. When talking to
the user, say **"everos-cloud 1.x (the v2 Memory API)"** — a bare "v2" is ambiguous
because the SDK version and the API version differ by one.

## Step 4: Discover the migration path

```
Glob pattern="migration/*/v*-to-v*.md" path="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
```

Rule directories are keyed by caller kind:
- `migration/http/` — transport-level rules, apply to every caller
- `migration/python/` — Python SDK rules, layered on top of the transport rules

Build the chain from current to target (e.g. v0 -> v2 = `v0-to-v1.md` + `v1-to-v2.md`).
If a required rule file is missing, tell the user and stop.

**Read `migration/http/vN-to-vM.md` before the language file for the same hop.** The
transport file is the semantic source of truth; the language file maps method
signatures onto it. When they disagree, the transport file wins.

## Step 5: Apply each migration step

For each hop, read the rule file(s) and apply changes to every file that touches
EverOS, **in this order**:

1. **Package dependency** (pyproject.toml / requirements.txt) — SDK callers only
2. **Environment variables** (.env, docker-compose, Dockerfile, CI, code, shell)
3. **Endpoint paths / base URLs** — raw HTTP callers, and any hardcoded URL in an SDK codebase
4. **Client instantiation** (constructor params)
5. **API call signatures / request bodies** (these may be full rewrites)
6. **Response field access**
7. **Type imports**
8. **Exception/error class references**

**Wildcard imports**: if code uses `from everos_cloud.types.v1 import *`, ask the user
to expand it to explicit imports first — wildcards make it impossible to track which
types need renaming.

**Non-source files matter.** Timestamps and endpoint paths hide in test fixtures, VCR
cassettes, Postman collections, `.http` files, seed scripts and docs. Search them too.

## Step 6: Suggest the package update

After code changes, **tell the user** to update their installed package:

- `pip install -U everos-cloud` or `uv sync`

Do NOT auto-run install commands. The user decides when and how to update.

## Step 7: Verify

Syntax-check modified Python files:

- `python -m py_compile <file>`

If tests exist, run them to verify collection.

### Limitations of syntax checking

Syntax checks catch import and syntax errors but **cannot** detect these, all of which
are valid Python that fails at runtime:

- **Seconds-scale timestamps** — a hard 422 on every write (http API-004)
- **`EVER_OS_BASE_URL` no longer read** — silently targets production (SDK-002)
- **Field-level attribute errors** — one `.data` level too many (SDK-011)
- **Mutually exclusive / required params** — `search()` with neither `user_id` nor
  `agent_id`; `get("episode", agent_id=...)` (owner/type mismatch) — 422 at runtime
- **Empty query string** — `search("")` is a 422
- **Return type changes** — `delete()` returned `None` in 0.4.x, a `DeleteData` in 1.x

To catch these, diff the modified code against the canonical example for the target
version and check that call shapes and field access match.

### Verification examples

```
Glob pattern="examples/*/v*.{py,go,ts}" path="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
```

Each `v{N}.{ext}` is the canonical usage for that major version. Diff the migrated code
against `v{target}.{ext}`. For minor-version hops the rule file is the primary
authority; fall back to the example only where the rule file is silent.

---

## Rules for the migration agent

- Each rule file is self-contained with Before/After code, search patterns, and field
  mappings. Follow it precisely.
- When a capability is **removed with no replacement**, FLAG it with a comment at the
  call site. Do NOT silently delete it, do NOT invent a replacement, and do NOT
  approximate one without saying so.
- Do NOT auto-add APIs that did not exist in the source version.
- For complex signature rewrites, restructure carefully — NOT find-and-replace.
- Never edit files in scan mode.

### Removals in the v1 -> v2 hop that must always be flagged, never rewritten

These decide whether the migration can complete at all. Count each one:

| Capability | Where |
|---|---|
| Group memory (`/memories/group`, `/groups`, `group_id` filters) | http API-012 / SDK-014 |
| Sender registry (`/senders`) | http API-013 / SDK-014 |
| Memory-space settings (`/settings`, timezone, LLM overrides) | http API-014 / SDK-014 |
| `AsyncEverOS` and every `await client.` call site | SDK-004 |
| `delete(memory_id=...)` single-memory delete | http API-009 / SDK-010 |
| `memory_type="raw_message"` | http API-007 / SDK-009 |
| `max_retries` / `http_client` / `default_headers` | SDK-003 |

`memory_type="agent_memory"` is not removed but **splits** into `agent_case` /
`agent_skill` — it needs a human decision per call site, so flag rather than guess.

## Impact Report

Produce this at the end of every run (in scan mode it is the whole output). Lead with
the blockers — the user's first question is "can I even do this", not "what changed".

```
EverOS migration impact: <current> -> <target>

BLOCKERS (no equivalent in the target version)
  <N> group-memory call sites          <file:line each>
  <N> sender-registry call sites       <file:line each>
  <N> settings call sites              <file:line each>
  <N> async (AsyncEverOS) call sites   <file:line each>
  <N> delete-by-memory_id call sites   <file:line each>
  -> If any of the above are non-zero, this migration cannot be completed by the
     tool alone. Contact EverOS before proceeding.

NEEDS A DECISION
  <N> agent_memory call sites (agent_case vs agent_skill)
  <N> EVER_OS_BASE_URL references not passed to host=  <- would silently hit PRODUCTION
  app_id / project_id scoping: <default / needs design because ...>

MECHANICAL (the tool can apply these)
  <N> endpoint paths
  <N> add() call sites
  <N> get()/search() scope rewrites
  <N> memory_type renames
  <N> timestamp seconds -> milliseconds
  <N> response .data unwraps
  <N> exception class references

ALSO NOTE
  - Existing v1 memories do NOT carry over to v2 — the v2 store starts empty.
    Plan a cutover (hard switch / dual-write / backfill) before shipping.
  - The API key does not change, and v1 keeps working during the transition.
  - The account must be v2-enabled or every v2 call returns 403 VERSION_NOT_ALLOWED.
```

In migrate mode, follow the report with the usual summary: files modified, changes per
category, and every FLAG comment inserted.
